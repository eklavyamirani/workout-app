# Workout Tracker

## Overview
```
This application is a workout tracker that I want to use to track my workouts. My goal for this app is to require minimal interactions to plan and track my workouts, and get insights (progressions, rest times, plateaus, deload time, etc).
``` 

## Features
- Customize your workout plan and use progress from last week as a blueprint for the following week.
- Track weights, progress and derive insights.
